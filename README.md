Py_WebTimeMachineAPI
====================

python wrapper for [Web Time Machine API](http://archive.org/web/)

basicly this is a tiny wrapper of Archive.org API, which returns the archived version of the page available, the one is closest to the input date. It returns also a status flag, whatewer returned link's date is within margins or not. At this time code is written to support Scraperwiki.com library, so you can just copy'n'paste code in there. Just replace current links array with your own.*


*I use shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/ to produce an array of links out of csv file
